## Inspiration
A few weeks ago, a friend of mine came over to try the Oculus Rift. I showed him Oculus Quill, which is a drawing app. He tried to explain the [geometric interpretation of the cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Geometric_meaning) in VR. It worked!

## What it does
Draw your lesson in VR, and hit record whenever you're ready! You can always change the position of the camera to help students better understand the 3D concepts that you've drawn.  

## How we built it
- Built drawing mechanism from scratch using custom MeshLineRenderer
- Use of raw Oculus Touch SDK to hack together all UI interactions 
- Take view from second camera as the exportable output 

## What's next for VR Teacher Studio 
More teaching tools, like access to pre-fabricated 3D object and different brush types/colors.
